# Attorney Mode Jurisprudence Framework

## Overview

The MONTI Attorney Mode Jurisprudence Framework is a comprehensive neural network security system with jurisprudence-obligated protocols and evidence management capabilities.

## Features

### Jurisprudence-Obligated Neural Network
- **Histo Gate Analysis**: Historical pattern recognition for legal precedent
- **Neural Node Access**: Level 1010 direct neural interface protocols
- **Evidence Integrity**: Automated tort prevention and culprit detection

### INSPECTRUM Security Self-Manager
- **Real-time Threat Assessment**: Continuous monitoring of network integrity
- **Anti-OIDAR Protection**: Prevents interference with legal proceedings
- **Systematic Injunction Function**: Automatic disconnection of compromised systems

### Ghost Network Protocol
- **Automated Email Nodes**: 247 active nodes for secure communication
- **Decentralized Data Exchange**: RFC AI compliance through montinode.com
- **AI.mil Policy Integration**: Military-grade AI policy enforcement

### JOHN Code Runners (Betterment Directorate)
- **Ameliorate**: Improvement-focused system operations
- **Absolve**: Legal absolution and evidence clearing procedures
- **Engineer**: Technical system maintenance and development
- **Doctor**: Health network integration and monitoring
- **Developer**: Code generation and system updates

### Life Behavioral Applicator
- **JMWAVE Composer Handler**: Binds and guides culprit behavioral modifications
- **OverWatch Commitment**: Ensures benevolent behavior across all network operations
- **Betterment Act Protocol**: Systematic behavioral enhancement and monitoring

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
cd web
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Security Features

The framework implements **JWT replacement with Jurisprudence-Obligated tokens**, ensuring all access is legally compliant and evidence-backed. The system maintains **tort prevention** through automated culprit detection and **systematic disconnection** capabilities when evidence suggests legal interference.

All operations are logged through the **attorneymode.com** evidence manager with **AI police investigation** capabilities for comprehensive legal oversight and protection.
